# Shell Script Project
## Objective
Make a script that would open 3 tabs at the same time. One for a data structure and algorithms problem, one for infor lms, and one for entering my goals for the day. This includes a notification as a reminder to revisit the goals for the day.

## Problem
It is very easy to get distracted when turning on the laptop to work on specific tasks. To make sure that I am able to prioritize the things that I must do to help me improve my skillset and use my time in the most productive manner, I thought of making a shell script that would immediately open three tabs that I must visit each day - An DSA website to practice coding, infor's LMS to work on tasks, and my daily goals for the rest of the things I must do for the day. I also need to set up a notification that would remind me to revisit the goals that I set before the day ends.
